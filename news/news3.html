- Revolt Motors begins deliveries of the RV400 <br>

- First batch delivered in Delhi <br>

- Bookings closed for November-December batch <br>
<br>
Revolt Motors is apparently off to a good start in India. After announcing that the bookings for its electric motorcycles have closed for this year, the Gurugram-based manufacturer has now affirmed that the deliveries of its top-spec e-bike, the RV400, have begun. The company handed-over the first batch of the electric motorcycle to its customers in Delhi. Besides the capital city, Revolt also has presence in Pune while it plans to expand to other cities of India soon. <br><br>

Revolt had launched its electric motorcycles, the RV400 and the RV300, in August this year. The e-bikes can be booked from the companyâ€™s website at an amount of Rs 1,000. While the company has closed bookings for the period of November-December, the customers can now book the bikes in the January-February 2020 batch. Notably, the motorcycles will be handed over to the customers as per the booking sequence.  <br><br>

Instead of launching its electric motorcycles with the conventional pricing method, Revolt Motors introduced the RV400 and RV300 with a unique EMI plan. While the former is available with a monthly installment plan of Rs 3,499 (standard) and Rs 3,999 (premium), the latter can be bought with Rs 2,999 per month scheme. The maximum tenure of these EMI plans is 37 months. Besides that, Revolt has recently introduced the one-time full payment plan under which the RV300 costs Rs 84,999 and the RV400 is pegged at Rs 98,999 (both prices are ex-showroom).   <br><br>
